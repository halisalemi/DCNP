The instances are collected from Transportation Networks (https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks) and the Hazmat Network Data (https://github.com/STOM-Group/Hazmat-Network-Data)

The following changes are applied to these graphs.
 
1. The vertices start with label 0 rather than 1.

2. If a graph has an isolated vertex, then it is removed and vertices are relabeled. 

3. In each graph, if the weights (distances) are not integer, then all of them are multiplied by a sufficient large number to become integer. 
   For example, if the weights have 2 decimals, they are multiplied by 100. 

4.  All edges {i,j} are sorted as i then j when i<j.
 
5.  Adjacency list is sorted.
